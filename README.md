Rules:

1. Any word that begins with “y” treat as a consonant (ex yellow = ellowyay)
2. Anything that isn’t a letter won’t be translated (#, %, $, 1, etc..)
3. Words that begin with a vowel, add “ay” to the end. (ex. i = iay)
4. If words start with one or more consonants until they reach a vowel, than move consonants to end of word and add “ay” (ex. translator = anslatortray)
5. If qu is the first two letters of the word, move to end of word and add “ay” (ex. quiet = ietquay)
6. If the word starts with a consonant and is followed by “qu” than move the first three letters to the end of the word and add “ay” ( ex. squeal = ealquay)
7. If consonant at beginning of word followed by vowel, move consonant to end of word and add “ay” (ex. latin = atinlay)
